# Face Shield Mod version RCâ™¥

![Face Shield v3.5](img/rendered_shield_small.png?raw=true)

This is a face-shield, not approved for any medical use, but designed
to be similar to the Prusa RC2 face shield, with the following differences:

 - Designed to be high-speed printed (in just over an hour if you have a 0.8mm nozzle)
 - Designed to be modified easily (hence the available [Fusion360](https://www.autodesk.ca/en/products/fusion-360/overview) file
   here: [Face Shield v3.5 Fusion 360 file](https://github.com/armyofevilrobots/printable_shield/blob/master/shield_toggle_wide_v3.5.f3d?raw=true)).
 - Designed to cover the sides and top of the head better, to prevent overspray from
   getting into the users' eyes.

## Usage



## Printing

You can view a 3D version of the shield here: [3D Rendered Shield](shield_toggle_wide_v3.5.stl).

I print this with an Ender3 at 250C and averaging 30mm/s speeds. Your mileage may vary. I
am including a 3MF file here: [Face Shield v3.4 FAST]().

If you want to print using your own slicer/settings, you can get the STL here: [Face Shield v3.5](https://github.com/armyofevilrobots/printable_shield/raw/master/shield_toggle_wide_v3.5.stl)

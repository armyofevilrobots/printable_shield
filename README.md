# Face Shield Mod version RC♥

![Face Shield v3.5](img/rendered_shield_small.png?raw=true)

This is a face-shield, not approved for any medical use, but designed
to be similar to the Prusa RC2 face shield, with the following differences:

 - Designed to be high-speed printed (in just over an hour if you have a 0.8mm nozzle)
 - Designed to be modified easily (hence the available [Fusion360](https://www.autodesk.ca/en/products/fusion-360/overview) file
   here: [Face Shield v3.5 Fusion 360 file](https://github.com/armyofevilrobots/printable_shield/blob/master/shield_toggle_wide_v3.5.f3d?raw=true)).
 - Designed to cover the sides and top of the head better, to prevent overspray from
   getting into the users' eyes.

## Usage

### Assembly

Be sure 3D printed head band is correctly oriented - pegs should be along bottom of band.
![Pegs are on the bottom](img/pegs_down.jpg?raw=true)

FACE SHIELD snaps onto pegs on top of the TOP  SHIELD tabs, but it’s easiest to attach both FACE  and TOP SHIELD at the same time, starting on one side,  working across the 4 pegs to the other side.

Attach elastic strap to fit. Use a buttonhole elastic, available at most sewing stores, cut to length (about 16 inches).

### DISINFECTING INSTRUCTIONS

Masks may be reused but need disinfecting before each use!

Use caution with heat - 3D printed parts  may warp over 100°C

Disassemble to disinfect, and be sure 3D printed parts lay flat or they may warp

## Printing

You can view a 3D version of the shield here: [3D Rendered Shield](shield_toggle_wide_v3.5.stl).

I print this with an Ender3 at 250C and averaging 30mm/s speeds. Your mileage may vary. I
am including a 3MF file here: [Face Shield v3.4 FAST](shield_toggle_wide_v3.4_FAST.3mf).

If you want to print using your own slicer/settings, you can get the STL here: [Face Shield v3.5](https://github.com/armyofevilrobots/printable_shield/raw/master/shield_toggle_wide_v3.5.stl)

## Laser Cutting

The shield transparent components are:

 - [The top shield](lasercut_files/TOPSHIELD_wide.pdf)
 - [The face shield](lasercut_files/FACESHIELD_wide.pdf)

There are also SVGs:
![Top Shield](https://raw.github.com/armyofevilrobots/printable_shield/master/lasercut_files/TOPSHIELD_wide.svg?sanitize=true)
![Face Shield](https://raw.github.com/armyofevilrobots/printable_shield/master/lasercut_files/FACESHIELD_wide.svg?sanitize=true)

These should be cut from 0.005" through 0.010" clear PETG sheet. If you have an amazingly powerful laser, you could use 0.020", but it's very 
finicky on a regular 65W laser engraver, and will likely crack at any size over 0.010".

Since most suppliers are unfamiliar with the chemical name, you can ask graphic design, art, and print houses for Grafix brand art plastic (stock#: K07CP1212-25), or Dura-Lar. These are completely sold out on Amazon at this time, but are probably available locally if you ask around art shops or craft/hobby stores. Don't be tempted to use the thicker sizes unless you have a very high power (150W+) or fiber laser.
